# 🎓 Student Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyses the Students Performance Dataset (1000 records, 8 features) to uncover insights into academic performance across subjects and demographics.  
The main goal is to understand which factors influence student success and to assign grades based on average scores.

## 📊 Dataset Information
- Source: [Students Performance Dataset (OpendataBay)](https://www.opendatabay.com/data/science-research/3ac285ec-ffdb-4813-a405-84a5351b326b)  
- Rows: 1000  
- Columns: 8  
- Features include:
  - Gender  
  - Race/Ethnicity  
  - Parental Level of Education  
  - Lunch (standard vs free/reduced)  
  - Test Preparation Course  
  - Math Score, Reading Score, Writing Score  

## 🎯 Objectives
1. Compute average score per student.  
2. Assign letter grades (A–F) based on performance.  
3. Identify top-performing students.  
4. Explore how demographics (gender, parental education, lunch, test prep) affect scores.  
5. Visualize grade distribution and performance trends.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- pandas → data manipulation  
- Jupyter Notebook → interactive analysis  

## 📈 Key Findings
- Students who completed test preparation scored 10–15% higher on average.  
- Female students outperformed males in Reading & Writing, while Math was more balanced.  
- Students with standard lunch scored higher than those with free/reduced lunch.  
- The top student achieved an average above 95 (Grade A).
